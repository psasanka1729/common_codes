"""
This function takes a sorted array of eigenvalues and computes the level spacing ratios, which are useful in the study of random matrix theory and quantum chaos.
What this code does:
     - Computes the consecutive level spacings (differences between consecutive eigenvalues).
     - Calculates the level spacing ratios r_n, which are the minimum of consecutive spacings divided by the maximum of consecutive spacings.
